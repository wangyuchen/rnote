# Numeric Examples Using R

R version of STAT 8320's SAS note.

Some general guidelines in writing this note: 
* To match the SAS output, some analysis isn't exactly done in R's way. 
* Built-in packages are preferred over other CRAN packages.
* For some results, a user-specified function instead of loading another package is usually preferred. 
* Package `ggplot2` is used whenever I can to produce high quality plots. I think it's a major advantage of R in terms of graphics.
